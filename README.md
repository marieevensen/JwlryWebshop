# JwlryWebshop

In this project we learned about using Sanity, and retrieve data from this external source. I really recommend using Sanity.

I made a webstore called Jwlry. In this store i retrieved the products from Sanity.

If you want other products, you can do:
- cd studio
- sanity start
- and then add products in the sanity

I also used vue so you can put products in the shoppingcart, change the quantity and buy them.
